# MazeGame

This is the repo for my personal video game project. I'm building it to improve my skills in C# and working with a popularly used game engine, Unity. 
I also have wanted to make an indie title myself for years, and I finally wanted to try and see what I can make.
I'm not entirely sure of the direction I'm going with the point of the game, but I'm mostly looking to figure out how to 
implement different mechanics and gameplay features before settling on any specific type of game. In all likelihood, I'm going 
to take my time with this project and develop on it incrementally.

Currently the project consists of a procedurally generated grid-style maze with the player spawned at the origin point.
There is also an 'enemy' placed in the maze, but at this point in time, it's just a GameObject that does not move. 

Movement is controlled with 'WASD' and to look around, use the mouse. To 'start' you can press the enter key or space bar; without 
pressing one of these keys you will be prevented from moving. Use the left mouse button to use a flashlight.
